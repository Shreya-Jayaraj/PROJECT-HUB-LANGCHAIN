# PROJECT-HUB-LANGCHAIN
 
Every campus deserves a dedicated project-hub website, where students can share a diverse range of projects, whether technical or non-technical. This platform aims to simplify the exchange of projects, presentations, and research papers.

My project hub chatbot is created to aid such a website. It serves as a valuable resource, ready to assist users with any queries related to specific projects, be it from GitHub, presentations, or research papers. This eliminates the need for students to directly approach project owners. It helps to provide instant clarification for any doubts. This ensures a smoother experience for both the project reader and the project owner, making knowledge-sharing more accessible and efficient on campus.

**Prerequisites**

Python must be pre-installed.
Libraries to be installed - openai, langchain, streamlit, YoutubeLoader. These can be installed using the command - 'pip install <library_name>' at the command prompt.

**Key Features and How to Use:**
Run the streamlit app by using the following command - streamlit run app.py
You can ask questions about PDFs and YouTube videos, and our chatbot will provide answers. It's a simple way to get information for your projects!

**Future Plans for the Project:**
Right now, my project is a basic LangChain-powered tool shown on Streamlit. But in the future, I hope to create a complete Project Hub website with an AI ChatBot. This chatbot can answer questions about any project on the website. Just ask your questions, and it will assist you!.
